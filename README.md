# StayHealthy – Online Doctor Consultation Platform

## Project Overview

StayHealthy Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare access in remote and underserved areas. As part of its Go Digital Initiative, StayHealthy aims to leverage increasing internet and broadband availability to connect patients with doctors and specialists anytime and anywhere.

This project focuses on designing and developing a user-friendly, intuitive, and accessible web platform that helps patients easily find doctors, book consultations, and manage their profiles online.

## Problem Statement

StayHealthy conducted an extensive survey and identified critical healthcare challenges in remote areas, including:

* Lack of nearby hospitals or doctors within a 50-mile radius
* Long waiting times for doctor consultations
* Delayed treatment leading to medical emergencies and, in some cases, loss of life

The proposed digital healthcare platform addresses these issues by enabling timely access to qualified doctors through online consultations and appointment scheduling.

## Project Objectives

* Provide easy and timely access to general physicians and specialists
* Enable online appointment booking and consultation management
* Improve transparency through doctor ratings and consultation feedback
* Maintain secure and manageable patient profiles
